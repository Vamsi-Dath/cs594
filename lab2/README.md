### Summary

This is a copy of [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch). 

The repository was used to demonstrate basic git and github concepts to students taking course [17645 - Machine Learning in Production](https://mlip-cmu.github.io/f2024/) in Fall 2024 at Carnegie Mellon University. I was the teaching assistant in charge of this lab assignment.

The exact details of the assignment can be found here - [https://github.com/mlip-cmu/f2024/blob/main/labs/lab03.md](https://github.com/mlip-cmu/f2024/blob/main/labs/lab03.md)
